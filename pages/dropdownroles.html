      <br>Users just have to run <code>/dropdownroles use</code> to send a dropdown which allows them to select up to <b>25</b> roles to add or remove from them. <br>If a user already has the role they select, it will be removed from them <br>
      <br>You can invite the bot <a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=848983677491740713&permissions=268435456&scope=bot%20applications.commands">here</a>
